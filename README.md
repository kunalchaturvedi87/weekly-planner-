# Weekly Planner — Because… why remember stuff yourself? 🗓️🙃

Turns out my brain has the memory of a goldfish 🐠, so I made this planner.  
It nags me when I forget things, and honestly, I kind of love it.

- **Tomorrow view** 👀 — so you can freak out ahead of schedule.

2. Add your stuff.  
3. Let the browser yell at you when it’s time.  
4. Pretend you’ve had your life together all along. 

## Tech Stuff (if you’re that kind of person)
